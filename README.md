# Opencode-Self-Improvement

Durable memory for opencode, plus a one-command per-repo setup.

## Why is this here?

LLMs waste a lot of tokens reading and re-reading your code and asking you for clarifications you've already given it. This tells it to store those decisions so the next time you hit a similar part of the code, it knows more and gets to the answer faster. 
## What you get

- **`memory_*` tools** — remember facts, decisions, and commands the agent should
  keep across sessions (`memory_init`, `memory_remember`, `memory_recall`,
  `memory_update`, `memory_forget`, `memory_list`, `memory_undo`,
  `memory_evidence`).
- **`/repo-init`** — for each repo: indexes the code graph and remembers the
  test/build commands, keyed to the git head. The command installs itself; no
  setup beyond the plugin.
- Automatically de-dupes similar memories and avoids contradictions by searching for existing memories before saving new ones.
- Automatically looks for insights when you complete the verification gates (tests, linting, etc)
- Always defaults to memories first before sending a prompt to the LLM, which saves tokens! 

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo and restart Opencode (see install below).
2. In any repo, run:

   ```
   /repo-init
   ```

That's it. Rerun `/repo-init force` after a refactor to refresh.

## How to install

1. Clone this repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abogartz/opencode-self-improvement.git
   cd opencode-self-improvement
   bun install
   ```

2. Point opencode at the plugin. Add a `plugin` entry to your opencode config —
   `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (global) or any project `opencode.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
     "plugin": ["/full/path/to/opencode-self-improvement/index.ts"]
   }
   ```

3. Quit and restart opencode. The plugin loads and `/repo-init` installs itself.
   Nothing else to do.

## Code graph (optional)

`/repo-init` also indexes the repo into a queryable knowledge graph via
[`codebase-memory-mcp`](https://github.com/DeusData/codebase-memory-mcp),
pinned to `0.11.0` as an optional dependency, so it comes in with the
`bun install` above. If a copy is already on your `PATH`, that one is used
instead; override explicitly with `OPENCODE_CBM_BIN=/path/to/codebase-memory-mcp`.
When no graph binary is available, `/repo-init` still records scripts and the
init stamp — the graph is a lookup bonus, not a requirement (see below).

Manual install of the pinned binary (if you want it globally):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeusData/codebase-memory-mcp/main/install.sh | bash
```

## First use

Run `/repo-init` once in every repo you work in. It:

- indexes the repo's code graph (`codebase-memory-mcp`), only when missing or forced;
- stores the test/lint/typecheck commands as memories;
- writes an init stamp tied to the current git head.

Ongoing use is just the memory tools. Ask the agent to remember something and it
sticks across sessions; check what's stored with `memory_list`, refine with
`memory_update`, retract with `memory_forget`, roll back with `memory_undo`.

## Admin Tool

Editing and deleting memories is easy!

Run `bun memory-view` in your terminal and visit  http://127.0.0.1:8787 in your browser. 

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `memory_*` tools not available | The plugin didn't load. Restart opencode and check the `plugin` entry points at `<clone>/index.ts`. |
| `/repo-init` missing from the command list | The self-install couldn't write to `~/.config/opencode/commands/` (e.g. read-only config dir). Create it, restart, or just ask the model to "init memory for this repo" — it calls the same tool. |
| Init says `Graph: unavailable` | `codebase-memory-mcp` couldn't start (not installed, or its once-only download is blocked). Install pinned `0.11.0` via the one-liner above, or point `OPENCODE_CBM_BIN` at the binary. Scripts are still remembered without it. |
| Stale plugin after an update | `git pull` the clone and restart opencode. |
| Reset all memories | Delete `~/.config/opencode/memory/`. |
